# 1DT305-Applied-IoT-Project

## Introduction

My name is Eric Weidow and I am an Electrical Engineering student at LTH in Lund, Sweden. As I wanted more practical experience with electronics and programming, I signed up for a summer course in Applied IoT a Linnaeus University (student credentials: ew223me), Sweden, and this project is part of that course.

The project is made up of a Raspberry Pi Pico WH (henceforth called **RP2**) with two sensors to measure air temperature, air humidity, and the soil moisture for an indoor plant. The data is sent via Wi-Fi to a backend, where the data is stored. A dashboard is then used to display the stored data to the user.

> TBD: Storage solution, vizualisation solution, approximate build time.

The goal of this project is being able to visualize and predict the soil humidity for an indoor plant, and notify the user when the plant should be watered. As both air temperature and air humidity is measured, the goal is that the prediction of when the plant needs to be watered can be improved based on this data. I will use this IoT device as a way for reminding me when to water my plants, as I have always been bad at taking care of them. Additionally, it will give me a great amount of experience with:

- Microcontrollers
- Sensors
- Communication between microcontrollers and sensors
- IoT concepts and principles
- Network protocols
- Cloud storage solutions
- Creating dashboards
- _...and much more!_

#### DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor is a cheap but reliable sensor with a digital signal output. The sensor is manufactured by Elegoo can be bought for 49 SEK [here, from electrokit.com](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/digital-temperatur-och-fuktsensor-dht11/).

Different datasheets showed different recommended voltages, from 3.3 V to 5 V. Testing showed that a V<sub>dd</sub> voltage of 3.3 V works very well. In this project V<sub>dd</sub> is supplied by pin 36 (`3V3(OUT)`) on the RP2. The Elegoo manufactured DHT11 includes a 10 k&Omega; pullup resistor, which means no extra resistor is needed in the circuit. Measurement specifications are included in Table 1, below.

<!-- From data sheet: DHT11â€™s power supply is 3-5.5V DC. When power is supplied to the sensor, do not send any instruction to the sensor in within one second in order to pass the unstable status. One capacitor valued 100nF can be added between VDD and GND for power filtering. -->

#### FC-28 Soil Moisture Sensor

The FC-28 Soil Moisture Sensor measures the resistance between the two exposed pads. This is converted to a voltage (0 to V<sub>CC</sub>) which can be measured by a microcontroller to determine the moisture of the soil. The sensor can be bought for 29 SEK [here, from electrokit.com](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/jordfuktighetssensor/).

The sensor requires an input voltage V<sub>CC</sub> of 3.3-5 V. In this project V<sub>CC</sub> = 3.3 V by supplying voltage from pin 36 (`3V3(OUT)`) on the RP2. The voltage measured by the sensor is availible on two different pinouts:

- The `AO` (Analog output) pinout can be measured to get the sensor's analog voltage of 0 to V<sub>CC</sub>.
- The `DO` (Digital output) pinout can be measured to get either 0 (`LOW`) or V<sub>CC</sub> (`HIGH`). The sensor has a comparator and a variable resistor on a chip. The voltage measured by the sensor is compared to the voltage produced using the variable resistor, which then sets the `DO` pinout to either `LOW` or `HIGH`.

In this project the `AO` pinout is used. The ADC (Analog-Digital Converter) on the RP2 pin converts the 0-3.3 V to a 16-bit number, between 0 and 65535. 0 corresponds to very low resistance (high moisture) and 65535 corresponds to very high resistance (low moisture).

### Computer setup

Make sure to go through every step of this setup so you don't miss downloading or installing anything.

#### Setting up the IDE

For the IDE I chose VS Code. The steps to setup VS Code for Windows with the correct extension (Pymakr) are the following:

1. Download and install the LTS release of Node.js [from this link](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Download and install VS Code [from this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
3. Open VS Code.
4. Open the **Extensions manager** from the left panel icon _OR_ press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>.
5. Search for the **Pymakr** extension and install it.

#### Flashing firmware to the RP2

With the IDE installed, the firmware now needs to be flashed to the RP2. Make sure you have your RP2 and the USB-cable for these steps:

1. Download the micropython firmware [from this link](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/). Make sure that you download the latest firmware from `Releases`, and **not** from `Nightly builds`. You will get a `.uf2` file.
2. Connect the **micro-usb** end of the cable to the RP2. Firmly hold the back of the USB slot when connecting the cable. There will probably be a small gap even when fully inserted, this is normal.
3. While holding the <kbd>BOOTSEL</kbd> button on the RP2, connect the **USB type A** end of the cable to your computer. When you have connected the cable you can release the <kbd>BOOTSEL</kbd> button.
4. There should be a new drive on your file system named `RPI-RP2`. This is the RP2 storage. Copy the `.uf2` file you downloaded earlier into this storage. **Do not disconnect the device during this installation! If you do you will most likely need to redo the above steps of flashing the firmware.**
5. Your RP2 should now automatically disconnect and reconnect.

#### Cloning and uploading the code

All code for this project is availible in [the GitHub repository you are currently in](https://github.com/Studsministern/1DT305-Applied-IoT-Project). To clone the code and upload it to the RP2, you should already have the IDE installed and the firmware flashed to the RP2. Then follow the steps below:

1. Find a place where you want to clone the code to. A folder will automatically be created when cloning code. But create a parent folder if you want to.
2. In VS Code, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the editor commands.
3. Write `Git: Clone` and choose `Git: Clone` when it shows up.
4. In the field which says `Provide repository URL or pick a repository source.`, copy and paste `https://github.com/Studsministern/1DT305-Applied-IoT-Project`. Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
5. Navigate to where you want the folder with code to be cloned to. Press <kbd>Select as Repository Destination</kbd>.
6. When it has finished cloding, a window saying "Would you like to open the cloned repository, or add it to the current workspace?" will show up. Press <kbd>Open</kbd>.
7. Create a file called `env.py` and copy the contents of `env.py.example` into it. Then change the variable values to your WiFi credentials, MQTT variables, etc.

You have now cloned the repository! Make sure the RP2 is connected to the computer. Upload the code to the RP2 by following these steps:

1. In VS Code, open **Pymakr** from the left panel icon. Find the device and press `Connect device` (a small lightning symbol) and `Create terminal` (a box with a right arrow).
2. Find `PYMAKR: PROJECTS` in either **Pymakr** or **Explorer** on the left panel.
3. Press <kbd>ADD DEVICES</kbd> and select the device.
4. Press `Sync project to device` (a cloud with an upwards arrow).
5. If you want the file contents to automatically update as you do changes, find `PYMAKR: PROJECTS` again. Hold your mouse over the project. Press <kbd></></kbd> (`Start development mode`).
